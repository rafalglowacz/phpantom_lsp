# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Known bugs and incorrect behaviour. These are distinct from feature
requests — they represent cases where existing functionality produces
wrong results. Bugs should generally be fixed before new features at
the same impact tier.

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

#### B15. Inline `@var` cast overrides variable type in same-line RHS

| | |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | Low |
| **Effort** | Low |

When an inline `/** @var T */` annotation precedes a reassignment
like `$data = $data->toArray()`, PHPantom resolves `$data` on the
RHS as type `T` instead of its previous type. The `@var` cast
should only apply to the variable after the assignment completes.

**Reproducer:**

```php
class Data {
    public function toArray(): array { return []; }
}
class Test {
    public function run(Data $data): array {
        /** @var array<string, mixed> */
        $data = $data->toArray();
        //      ^^^^^ resolved as array<string, mixed> instead of Data
        return $data;
    }
}
```

Produces: `Cannot access method 'toArray' on type 'array<string, mixed>'`

**Root cause:** This is a variant of B13 (variable type resolved from
reassignment target inside RHS). B13 was fixed for the case where the
assignment target name matches the variable in the RHS expression,
but the `@var` inline annotation applies the type override before the
RHS is evaluated, so the check does not catch it.

**Impact in shared codebase:** 2 false positives (Klarna.php and
GoogleTagManagerClient.php, both using `/** @var array<string, mixed> */
$data = $data->toArray()`).

#### B17. Static property access subject resolves to containing class instead of property type

| | |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | Low |
| **Effort** | Low |

When a static property is accessed via `self::$prop->method()`,
PHPantom resolves the member-access subject to the class containing
the static property instead of the property's declared type.

**Reproducer:**

```php
class Connection {
    public function setConfig(Config $config): void {}
}

class ConnectionManager {
    private static Connection $instance;

    public static function getInstance(): Connection {
        self::$instance->setConfig($config);
        //              ^^^^^^^^^ "Method 'setConfig' not found on class 'ConnectionManager'"
        return self::$instance;
    }
}
```

PHPantom reports `setConfig` not found on `ConnectionManager` instead
of looking it up on `Connection` (the declared type of `$instance`).

**Root cause:** The diagnostic subject resolution in
`src/diagnostics/unknown_members.rs` — the `StaticAccess` →
`PropertyChain` path returns the class that owns the static property
rather than the property's type hint.

**Impact in shared codebase:** 1 false positive
(`MobilePayConnectionManager::$instance->setMobilePayConnectionConfiguration()`).

#### B18. Null-init variable + loop reassignment doesn't build union type

| | |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | Low |
| **Effort** | Medium |

When a variable is initialized to `null` and conditionally reassigned
inside a loop, PHPantom resolves the variable to `null` without
considering the reassignment sites.  Guard clauses like
`$var !== null` can't narrow the type because the variable was never
resolved to a union containing both `null` and the real type.

**Reproducer:**

```php
$lastPaidEnd = null;
foreach ($periods as $period) {
    $lastPaidEnd = $period->end;  // CarbonImmutable
}
if ($lastPaidEnd !== null && $lastPaidEnd->diffInDays() > 30) { ... }
//                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^ "on type 'null'"
```

PHPantom should build a union `CarbonImmutable|null` from both
assignment sites, then the `!== null` guard should narrow it to
`CarbonImmutable`.

**Root cause:** `walk_statements_for_assignments` in
`src/completion/variable/resolution.rs` doesn't aggregate all
assignment sites for a variable into a union type.  It picks the
first or most recent assignment rather than building a union from
all reachable assignments.

**Impact in shared codebase:** 1 false positive
(CustomerService.php L302 — `diffInDays` on `null`).

---

#### B19. Guard clause with `continue`/`return` doesn't narrow type

| | |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | Low |
| **Effort** | Low |

After `if (!$var) { continue; }` or `if (!$var) { return; }`,
PHPantom should narrow `$var` to non-null (or non-falsy) in the
code that follows.  Currently the nullable type persists.

**Reproducer:**

```php
$warehouseOrderline = $warehouseOrderLines[$key] ?? null;
if (!$warehouseOrderline) {
    continue;
}
$warehouseOrderline->actualAmount;  // "on type 'null'"
```

After the `continue`, `$warehouseOrderline` is guaranteed non-null,
but PHPantom still sees `null`.

**Root cause:** `src/completion/variable/resolution.rs` — early-exit
narrowing (guard clause + `continue`/`return`/`throw`/`break`) is
not implemented for the variable type resolution path.

**Impact in shared codebase:** 2 false positives (PCNService.php
L1073 `actualAmount`, L1077 `amount`).
