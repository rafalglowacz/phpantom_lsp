## Severity philosophy

PHPantom assigns diagnostic severity based on runtime consequences:

## D4. Unused variable diagnostic

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Flag variables that are assigned but never read. This is one of the
most common issues in PHP codebases and catches dead code, typos in
variable names, and forgotten refactoring leftovers.

PHPantom already has an undefined-variable diagnostic
(`undefined_variable` in `diagnostics/undefined_variables.rs`) that
tracks variable definitions and reads through scope analysis. The
unused-variable diagnostic is the dual: a variable that has a
definition site but zero read sites within the same scope.

**Severity:** Information (rendered as dimmed text). Assigned-but-
unread variables are not bugs per se (the code still runs), but they
are strong signals of dead code or typos. Information severity avoids
alarming users while still making the issue visible.

**Diagnostic code:** `unused_variable` (matches the planned CLI fix
rule FX2).

### Scope

1. **Local variables in function/method bodies.** A variable assigned
   inside a function or method body that is never read before the
   scope ends. Parameters count as assignments; an unused parameter
   in a non-abstract, non-interface method is flagged.
2. **Foreach bindings.** `foreach ($items as $key => $value)` where
   `$key` or `$value` is never read inside the loop body. Convention:
   variables named `$_` or starting with `$_` are exempt (intentional
   discard).
3. **Catch variables.** `catch (Exception $e)` where `$e` is never
   read. Same `$_` exemption applies.

### Exclusions

- Variables in the global scope (scripts, templates).
- Variables passed by reference (`&$var`) to functions, since the
  callee may use them as out-parameters.
- Variables used inside closures or arrow functions that capture them
  (explicit `use ($var)` or implicit capture).
- Compact() calls that reference the variable by string name.
- Variables used in string interpolation (`"Hello $name"`).
- Variables whose RHS has side effects (method calls, function calls)
  should still be flagged, but with a detail note that removing the
  assignment would also remove the side effect.

### PHPStan parallel

PHPStan does not have a built-in unused-variable rule, but third-party
rulesets (e.g. `phpstan-strict-rules`, `tomasvotruba/unused-public`)
report similar issues. When D4 ships, the PHPStan quick-fix
infrastructure should recognise our native `unused_variable` code so
that:

- The "Remove unused import" pattern can be extended to offer a
  "Remove unused variable" quick-fix (same code action kind).
- FX2 (`unused_variable` CLI fix rule) can consume our diagnostic
  directly without needing PHPStan.

### Implementation

1. Extend the scope collector (`scope_collector/mod.rs`) to track
   read sites per variable per frame (it already tracks definition
   sites for the undefined-variable diagnostic).
2. After processing a scope, iterate defined variables and flag any
   that have zero reads and are not in the exclusion list.
3. Emit diagnostics with `DiagnosticSeverity::HINT` and
   `DiagnosticTag::UNNECESSARY` so editors render unused variables
   as dimmed/faded text.
4. Add a code action (in `code_actions/`) to remove the assignment
   statement when the RHS is side-effect-free, or to prefix the
   variable with `$_` to suppress the diagnostic.

## D3. Deprecated rendering — chain subject resolution

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

Chain subjects like `getHelper()->deprecatedMethod()` do not produce
a deprecated diagnostic because `resolve_subject_to_class_name` in
`diagnostics/deprecated.rs` returns `None` for non-variable,
non-keyword subjects (the `_ => None` arm). The function call return
type is never resolved, so the member deprecation check is skipped.

**Fix:** Route chain subjects through the completion/type-inference
pipeline to resolve the return type of the call before checking the
member for deprecation. The variable-resolution path already works
for `$var->deprecatedMethod()` via `resolve_variable_subject`; the
gap is function-call and method-call return types in subject position.

The following have been verified and are covered by tests:

- Deprecated class references in `new`, type hints, `extends`, and
  `implements` positions all render with strikethrough.
- Deprecated method calls, property accesses, and constants render
  with strikethrough (via both `$var->` and `ClassName::` subjects).
- Offset-based class resolution for `$this`/`self`/`static` resolves
  to the correct class in files with multiple class declarations.

## D5. Diagnostic suppression intelligence

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When PHPantom proxies diagnostics from external tools, users need a way
to suppress specific warnings. Rather than forcing them to install a
separate extension or memorise each tool's suppression syntax, PHPantom
can offer **code actions to insert the correct suppression comment** for
the tool that produced the diagnostic.

PHPStan suppression is implemented: "Ignore PHPStan error" adds
`// @phpstan-ignore <identifier>` (appending to existing ignores when
present), and "Remove unnecessary @phpstan-ignore" cleans up unmatched
ignores reported by PHPStan. What remains:

### Remaining tools

- PHPCS: `// phpcs:ignore [Sniff.Name]` or `// phpcs:disable` /
  `// phpcs:enable` blocks.
- PHPMD (3.0): `#[SuppressWarnings(RuleName::class)]` as a PHP attribute.
- For PHPantom's own diagnostics: support `@suppress phpantom.*`
  in docblocks (matching PHP Tools' convention) and a config flag
  `phpantom.diagnostics.enabled: bool` (default `true`).

**Prerequisites:** Each tool needs a diagnostic proxy before its
suppression actions can be wired up.

---

## D6. Unreachable code diagnostic

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Dim code that appears after unconditional control flow exits:
`return`, `throw`, `exit`, `die`, `continue`, `break`. This is a
Phase 1 (fast) diagnostic since it requires only AST structure, not
type resolution.

### Behaviour

| Scenario                                           | Rendering                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Code after `return $x;` in same block              | Dimmed (DiagnosticTag::UNNECESSARY) |
| Code after `throw new \Exception()`                | Dimmed                              |
| Code after `exit(1)` or `die()`                    | Dimmed                              |
| Code after `continue` or `break` in a loop         | Dimmed                              |
| Code after `if (...) { return; } else { return; }` | Dimmed (both branches exit)         |

Severity: **Hint** with `DiagnosticTag::UNNECESSARY` so editors dim
the text rather than underlining it. This matches how unused imports
are rendered.

### Implementation

Walk the AST statement list. After encountering a statement that
unconditionally exits the current scope (return, throw, expression
statement containing `exit`/`die`), mark all subsequent statements in
the same block as unreachable. The span covers from the start of the
first unreachable statement to the end of the last statement in the
block.

Phase 1 only handles the simple single-block case. Whole-branch
analysis (both if/else branches exit) is a future refinement.

### Debugging value

When our type engine silently resolves a method to a `never` return
type (e.g. an incorrectly resolved overload), unreachable code after
the call becomes visible, signalling the bug.

## D10. PHPMD diagnostic proxy

**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

Proxy PHPMD (PHP Mess Detector) diagnostics into the editor, following
the same pattern as the existing PHPStan proxy. PHPMD 3.0 (once
released) is the target version. It will get a `[phpmd]` TOML section
with `command`, `timeout`, and tool-specific options mirroring the
`[phpstan]` schema.

### Prerequisites

- PHPMD 3.0 must be released. Current 2.x output formats and rule
  naming may change.
- The diagnostic suppression code action (D5) should support PHPMD's
  `@SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.[RuleName])` syntax once the proxy exists.

### Implementation

1. Add a `[phpmd]` section to the config schema in `src/config.rs`
   with `command` (default `"vendor/bin/phpmd"`), `timeout`, and
   an `enabled` flag.
2. Run PHPMD with XML or JSON output on the current file (or changed
   files) and parse the results into LSP diagnostics.
3. Map PHPMD rule names to diagnostic codes so that suppression
   actions (D5) can insert the correct `@SuppressWarnings` annotation.
4. Respect the same debounce and queueing logic used by the PHPStan
   proxy to avoid overwhelming the tool on rapid edits.

## D12. Mago diagnostic proxy

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Proxy Mago the same way PHPantom proxies PHPStan and PHPCS:
auto-detect the binary, spawn it on file changes, parse JSON
output, and surface diagnostics in the editor.

**Why proxy, not in-process:** PHPantom already vendors several
mago crates for parsing, but the `mago-linter` crate contains
~159 lint rules with their own configuration surface. Building it
in-process would mean PHPantom owns every false positive those
rules produce, must duplicate or re-expose mago's `mago.toml`
config format, and must document and support someone else's rule
options. An opt-in toggle that 99% of users never discover is
wasted effort. The proxy approach lets users who already use Mago
get diagnostics automatically: they already have a `mago.toml`
with rules tuned for their codebase, baselines for known issues,
and framework integrations configured. PHPantom just shows what
Mago reports.

### Auto-detection

Enable automatically when the project has `mago.toml` at the
workspace root and `vendor/bin/mago` (or `mago` on `$PATH`)
exists. Same resolution chain as PHPStan/PHPCS: explicit
`.phpantom.toml` command > Composer bin-dir > `$PATH`. Setting
the command to `""` disables the proxy.

### Execution

Mago has two separate commands, both accepting `--stdin-input`
and `--reporting-format json`:

- **`mago lint`** — AST-level rules: style, naming, code smells,
  best practices (e.g. `strict-types`, `file-name`,
  `prefer-arrow-function`). Comparable to PHPCS. Fast.
- **`mago analyze`** — Static analysis with type inference: type
  mismatches, unreachable code, unused definitions. Comparable
  to PHPStan. Slower.

A project's `mago.toml` can configure either or both via
`[linter]` and `[analyzer]` sections. PHPantom should run
whichever the project has configured. When both are present,
run `mago lint` on the fast path (same debounce as PHPCS) and
`mago analyze` on the slow path (same debounce/worker pattern
as PHPStan: single pending URI, configurable timeout,
cancellation on new edits). Use `source: "mago-lint"` and
`source: "mago-analyze"` to distinguish the two.

### JSON output mapping

Mago's JSON output provides everything needed:

- `level` (Error, Warning, Note, Help) maps to LSP severity.
- `code` (rule name, e.g. `strict-types`, `no-empty`) becomes
  the diagnostic code.
- `annotations[].span` provides file, offset, and line for the
  diagnostic range.
- `edits` provides auto-fix `TextEdit`s with a `safety`
  classification (safe, potentially-unsafe, unsafe).

Mark diagnostics with `source: "mago-lint"` or
`source: "mago-analyze"` depending on the originating command.

### Quick-fix code actions from edits

Mago's JSON includes fix edits with safety levels. Convert these
to LSP `CodeAction`s:

- `safe` fixes: offer as preferred quick-fix.
- `potentially-unsafe` / `unsafe` fixes: offer as non-preferred
  quick-fix with the safety level noted in the action title.

### Configuration

Add a `[mago]` section to `.phpantom.toml`:

- `command` — explicit path to the mago binary (default:
  auto-detect).
- `timeout` — per-invocation timeout in seconds (default: 30).

No rule-level configuration in `.phpantom.toml`. The user
configures rules in `mago.toml` where they belong.

### Files

- `src/mago.rs` — `resolve_mago`, `run_mago_lint`,
  `run_mago_analyze`, `parse_mago_json`, JSON structs.
  Shared binary resolution (one binary, two commands).
- `src/server.rs` — two workers: `mago_lint_worker` (fast,
  PHPCS-like debounce) and `mago_analyze_worker` (slow,
  PHPStan-like debounce). Both follow the existing
  single-pending-URI pattern.
- `src/config.rs` — `MagoConfig` struct.
- `src/code_actions/mago/` — quick-fix code actions from edits.

## D13. Unify diagnostic subject resolution with completion/hover

`unknown_members.rs` has two secondary resolvers that run their own
independent type resolution when `resolve_target_classes_expr` returns
empty:

- `resolve_scalar_subject_type` (~130 lines) re-resolves variables,
  property chains, and call expressions to detect scalar types.
- `resolve_unresolvable_class_subject` (~80 lines) re-resolves
  variables and call expressions to detect class names that can't be
  loaded.

Both duplicate logic from `resolver.rs` and
`variable/resolution.rs` but can diverge, producing diagnostics for
types that completion and hover cannot see (or vice versa).

### Goal

The diagnostic path should use the same resolution result that
completion and hover use. All three consumers should see identical
outcomes for the same subject text at the same cursor position.

### Approach

Extend the shared resolver's return type (or add a secondary result)
to carry scalar type information and unresolvable class names
alongside the resolved `ClassInfo` list. The diagnostic collector
would then inspect this enriched result instead of running its own
resolution. This eliminates the secondary resolvers entirely.

### Files

- `src/diagnostics/unknown_members.rs` — remove
  `resolve_scalar_subject_type` and `resolve_unresolvable_class_subject`
- `src/completion/resolver.rs` — enrich the resolution result

## D14. Tighten argument type mismatch diagnostic (Phase 2)

**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

`is_type_compatible` in `src/diagnostics/type_errors.rs` silences
several cases that are genuine bugs at runtime. Phase 1 was
intentionally permissive to avoid false positives while the engine
matured; Phase 2 tightens the remaining gaps. PHPStan and Psalm
already flag most of these.

### 1. Nullable arg → non-nullable param (lines 264–271)

Currently silenced with a MAYBE comment ("developer may have guarded
against null"). This is the #1 source of runtime `TypeError` in
PHP 8+. Both PHPStan and Psalm flag it. Should be reported at least
as **Warning** severity, since the null path may be unguarded.

### 2. `void` as argument (lines 94–96)

Currently silenced conservatively. Passing the return value of a
`void` function is always a bug — PHP 8 returns `null` but the call
site clearly misunderstands the API. Should be **Error** severity.

### 3. `int` → `string` type juggling (lines 313–322)

Currently unconditionally accepted because we can't know the
`strict_types` setting. Under `declare(strict_types=1)` this is a
`TypeError`. Consider detecting the `declare` statement in the file
and flagging when strict types are enabled. When the declare is
absent or set to `0`, keep the current permissive behaviour.

### 4. Union any-member-compatible threshold (lines 189–213)

Currently: if ANY single member of an arg union is compatible with
the param, the entire union passes. Combined with the other
permissive rules above, this creates cascading permissiveness (e.g.
`null|BadType` passes a `string` param because `null` is not
checked, then `BadType` is the "any" member that gets skipped).
Consider requiring all non-null members to be compatible, or at
least flagging when a majority of members are incompatible.

### 5. Reverse hierarchy acceptance (Direction 2)

Currently: when the arg type is a *supertype* of the param type
(e.g. `CarbonInterface` passed to `Carbon`), the diagnostic is
silenced for all non-final classes because "the value *might* be
the narrower type at runtime." This means the diagnostic can only
catch type errors between completely unrelated classes, which
severely limits its value. Passing `Animal` where `Dog` is expected
is silently accepted.

This is the single largest gap in the diagnostic. Tightening it
requires control-flow analysis (instanceof guards, assert calls) to
know whether the broader type was actually narrowed before the call
site. Without CFA, the false positive rate would be high. Consider
reporting at **Warning** severity with a message like "argument type
`Animal` is broader than expected `Dog`; verify the value was
narrowed before this call."
