# PHPantom — Type Inference

Type resolution gaps: generic resolution, conditional return types,
type narrowing, PHP version features, and stub attribute handling.
Items that are purely about *completion UX* or *stub metadata
extraction* live in [completion.md](completion.md).

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

## T1. Inherited docblock type propagation
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

When a child class overrides a method from a parent class or interface,
the ancestor's richer docblock types should flow down unconditionally.
Inheritance is the default — if the ancestor says `@return list<Pen>`
and the child just says `: array`, the resolved return type must be
`list<Pen>`. There is no opt-in; `@inheritDoc` is functionally
meaningless because a child that can run code already has the parent's
contract. The only thing that *blocks* inheritance is the child
providing its own docblock type that is equally or more specific.

**Example:**

```php
interface PenHolder {
    /** @return list<Pen> */
    public function getPens(): array;
}

class Drawer implements PenHolder {
    // No docblock — native return type is just `array`.
    public function getPens(): array { return []; }
}

$d = new Drawer();
$d->getPens()[0]-> // ← should complete Pen members
```

Today `Drawer::getPens()` resolves to `return_type: "array"` because
the method's own docblock has no `@return` tag and the native hint is
`array`. The interface's `@return list<Pen>` is never consulted.

**Root cause:** `resolve_class_with_inheritance` (inheritance.rs L155)
and `resolve_class_fully_inner` (virtual_members/mod.rs L360) both
skip a parent/interface method when the child already declares one
with the same name — the child wins unconditionally. No fallback
check compares the richness of the return type.

**What needs to change:**

1. **During inheritance merging** (`resolve_class_with_inheritance`):
   when the child already has a method with the same name, don't
   just skip — enrich it. If the child's `return_type` equals its
   `native_return_type` (i.e. no docblock refined it) and the
   ancestor's `return_type` differs from its `native_return_type`
   (i.e. the ancestor *does* have a richer docblock type), copy the
   ancestor's `return_type` onto the child's method. Do the same
   for each parameter's `type_hint` when the child's matches its
   `native_type_hint`. Also inherit `description` and
   `return_description` when the child lacks them.

   **Parameter name remapping.** When propagating `@param` types,
   match by position, not by name. A child may rename `$userId` to
   `$id`; the parent's `@param int $userId` at position 0 should
   still flow to the child's position 0. PHPStan's
   `PhpDocInheritanceResolver` builds an explicit positional mapping
   for this.

2. **During interface merging** (`resolve_class_fully_inner`): same
   logic — when an interface method is skipped because the class
   already defines it, enrich the existing method with the
   interface's richer types and descriptions.

3. **Child docblock wins when present.** If the child provides its
   own `@return` or `@param` type (even if less specific), that is
   an intentional override and the ancestor type is not propagated.
   The test is simple: does the child's effective type differ from
   its native type? If yes, the child wrote a docblock — respect it.

**Scope of the fix:** This affects completion (return type drives
chain resolution), hover (return type displayed), and signature help
(parameter types shown). All three automatically benefit once the
merged `MethodInfo` carries the richer type.

**Properties too:** The same pattern applies to properties. An
interface declaring `@property-read list<Pen> $pens` should
propagate to an implementing class's `$pens` property if the class
only has a native `array` type hint.

---

## T2. File system watching for vendor and project changes
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

### `textDocument/didSave` handler

PHPantom does not currently implement `textDocument/didSave`. This
means changes to files that are not open in the editor (e.g. files
saved by a script, a git checkout, or another tool) are invisible
until the file is opened. This is standard behaviour for most LSPs,
but it matters for the file-watching story: even after
`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` is wired up for Composer artifacts,
changes to user PHP files made outside the editor (e.g. code
generation, `artisan make:model`) will not be picked up until the
file is opened.

When file system watching is implemented, consider also registering
a `didSave` handler (or a broad `*.php` watcher) to trigger a
targeted single-file rescan for files in PSR-4 directories, matching
the plan described in [indexing.md Phase 2](indexing.md#phase-2-staleness-detection-and-auto-refresh).

---

## T3. Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8.4 introduced property hooks (`get` / `set`):

```php
class User {
    public string $name {
        get => strtoupper($this->name);
        set => trim($value);
    }
}
```

The mago parser (v1.8) already produces `Property::Hooked` and
`PropertyHook` AST nodes, and the generic `.modifiers()`, `.hint()`,
`.variables()` methods mean hooked properties are extracted for basic
completion. However:

- **Hook bodies are never walked.** Variables and anonymous classes
  inside `get`/`set` bodies are invisible to resolution.
- **`$value` parameter** inside `set` hooks is not offered for
  variable completion.
- **Asymmetric visibility** (`public private(set) string $name`) is
  not recognised — the `set` visibility is ignored, so filtering
  may incorrectly allow setting a property that should be
  write-restricted.

**Fix:** In `extract_class_like_members`, match `Property::Hooked`
explicitly, walk hook bodies for anonymous classes and variable
scopes, and parse the set-visibility modifier into a new
`set_visibility` field on `PropertyInfo`.

### Asymmetric visibility (also PHP 8.4 / 8.5)

Separate from hooks, PHP 8.4 allows asymmetric visibility on plain
and promoted properties. PHP 8.5 extended this to static properties.

```php
class Settings {
    public private(set) string $name;

    public function __construct(
        public protected(set) int $retries = 3,
    ) {}
}
```

PHPantom currently extracts a single `Visibility` per property.
Completion filtering uses this to decide whether a property should
appear. A `public private(set)` property should appear for reading
from outside the class but not for assignment contexts.

Add an optional `set_visibility: Option<Visibility>` to
`PropertyInfo`. Populate it from the AST modifier list (the parser
exposes the set-visibility keyword). Completion filtering does not
currently distinguish read vs write contexts, so the immediate fix
is just to store the value; context-aware filtering can follow later.

This shares the same `set_visibility` field as the hooked-property
fix above, so both should be implemented together.

---

## T4. Non-empty-* type narrowing and propagation
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

PHPStan tracks `non-empty-string` and `non-empty-array` through
built-in functions. These narrowings don't directly enable
class-based completion, but they improve hover type display and
would catch bugs if we add diagnostics. All three sub-items share
the same implementation pattern (function-name-triggered type
narrowing in conditions or return types) and should be implemented
together.

**String containment narrowing.** When `str_contains($haystack,
$needle)` appears in a condition and `$needle` is known to be a
non-empty string, narrow `$haystack` to `non-empty-string`. Same
for `str_starts_with`, `str_ends_with`, `strpos`, `strrpos`,
`stripos`, `strripos`, `strstr`, and the `mb_*` equivalents.
See `StrContainingTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

**Count narrowing.** `if (count($arr) > 0)` or
`if (count($arr) >= 1)` narrows `$arr` to `non-empty-array`.
PHPStan handles a full matrix of comparison operators and integer
range types against `count()` / `sizeof()` calls. See
`CountFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension`.

**String function propagation.** Passing a `non-empty-string` to
`addslashes()`, `urlencode()`, `htmlspecialchars()`,
`escapeshellarg()`, `escapeshellcmd()`, `preg_quote()`,
`rawurlencode()`, or `rawurldecode()` should return
`non-empty-string`. See `NonEmptyStringFunctionsReturnTypeExtension`.

---

## T5. Fiber type resolution
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`Generator<TKey, TValue, TSend, TReturn>` has dedicated support for
extracting each type parameter (value type for foreach, send type
for `$var = yield`, return type for `getReturn()`). `Fiber` has no
equivalent handling — `Fiber::start()`, `Fiber::resume()`, and
`Fiber::getReturn()` don't resolve their generic types.

PHP userland rarely annotates Fiber with generics (unlike Generator),
so this is low priority. If demand appears, the fix would mirror the
Generator extraction in `docblock/types.rs`.

---

## T6. `Closure::bind()` / `Closure::fromCallable()` return type preservation
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Variables holding closure literals, arrow functions, and first-class
callables now resolve to the `Closure` class, so `$fn->bindTo()`,
`$fn->call()`, etc. offer completions.  The remaining gap is
*preserving the closure's callable signature* through `Closure::bind()`
and resolving `Closure::fromCallable('functionName')` to the actual
function's signature as a typed `Closure`.  This is relevant for DI
containers and middleware patterns but is a niche use case.

See `ClosureBindDynamicReturnTypeExtension` and
`ClosureFromCallableDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## T7. `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom already parses `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` as type keywords
but does not resolve them to concrete types. When `T` is bound to a
concrete array type, these utility types should resolve:

- `value-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `string|int`
- `key-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `'a'|'b'`
- `value-of<array<string, User>>` → `User`
- `key-of<array<string, User>>` → `string`

These types commonly appear in PHPStan-typed libraries and in
`@template` constraints. For example:

```php
/**
 * @template T of array
 * @param T $array
 * @return value-of<T>
 */
function first(array $array): mixed;
```

**Implementation:** plug into the generic substitution pipeline in
`inheritance.rs` / `completion/types/resolution.rs`. After template
parameters are substituted with concrete types, detect `key-of<...>`
and `value-of<...>` wrappers and resolve them by inspecting the inner
type:

- If the inner type is an `array{...}` shape, collect the key or value
  types from the shape fields.
- If the inner type is `array<K, V>`, extract `K` or `V` directly.
- If the inner type is still an unresolved template parameter, leave
  it as-is (it may resolve later in the chain).

---



## T9. Dead-code elimination after `never`-returning calls
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

When a function or method has return type `never`, any code path that
calls it is guaranteed to terminate. Variables assigned before the
`never` call in a conditional branch should not have their type
polluted by the branch's assignments.

```php
$x = 'hello';
if (rand(0,1)) {
    $x = 'other';
    abort(); // returns never
}
$x; // should be "hello", not "hello"|"other"
```

Today PHPantom's branch-merging logic unions all branch assignments
regardless of whether the branch terminates. Recognising `never` as a
terminating statement (alongside `return`, `throw`, `die`, `exit`)
would fix this.

**Fixture to activate:**

- `type/never_return_type.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `type/never.test`

---

## T10. Ternary expression as RHS of list destructuring
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

List destructuring (`[$a, $b] = expr`) resolves element types when
the RHS is a function call returning an array shape, or a simple
array literal. When the RHS is a ternary expression whose branches
are array literals or array-shape-returning calls, the resolver
doesn't drill into the branches to union the element types.

```php
[$a, $b] = $cond ? [new Foo(), new Bar()] : [new Bar(), new Foo()];
$a->  // should see Foo|Bar members
```

**Fixture to activate:**

- `assignment/list_destructuring_conditional.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `assignment/list_assignment.test`

---

## T11. Nested list destructuring
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Nested destructuring like `[[$one, $two]] = $source` is not resolved.
When the RHS has a type like `array{array{Foo, Bar}}`, the outer
destructuring peels the first dimension but the inner destructuring
doesn't resolve individual elements.

```php
/** @return array{array{Foo, Bar}} */
function getPair(): array { return [[new Foo(), new Bar()]]; }

[[$one, $two]] = getPair();
$one->  // should see Foo members
```

**Fixture to activate:**

- `assignment/nested_list_destructuring.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `assignment/list_desconstruct_nested.test`

---

## T12. Intersection types flattened to unions by `type_strings_joined`
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low (after M4)**

`ResolvedType::type_strings_joined` joins all resolved type entries
with `|`. When a variable has an intersection type (`A&B`), the
resolution pipeline produces separate `ResolvedType` entries for each
part, and the join produces `A|B` instead of `A&B`.

This affects any consumer that reads the joined type string, including
hover display, extract function parameter types, and docblock
generation on extracted methods.

**Example:**

```php
function measure(Countable&Serializable $thing): void {
    // Select and extract:
    echo $thing->count();
}
// Extracted method gets `Countable|Serializable $thing` instead of
// `Countable&Serializable $thing`.
```

**Blocked by M4.** The fix requires `PhpType::Intersection` from the
mago-type-syntax migration. The current `Vec<ResolvedType>` has no way
to distinguish "these types form an intersection" from "these types
form a union". With `PhpType`, the intersection is a single tree node.

**After fixing:** verify that extract function docblock generation
preserves intersection types in both the native hint and the `@param`
tag.

---

## T13. Closure variables lose callable signature detail
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a variable holds a closure or arrow function, the resolution
pipeline resolves it to the `Closure` class name. The callable
signature (parameter types, return type) is lost. This means:

1. Passing `$fn` to an extracted method produces `Closure $fn` with
   `@param (Closure(): mixed)` instead of the concrete signature.
2. An explicit `/** @var (Closure(int): string) $fn */` annotation
   is recognised by variable resolution (`find_var_raw_type_in_source`
   returns the annotated type), but `clean_type_for_signature` now
   correctly extracts `Closure` as the native hint. The raw type is
   preserved for docblock generation.

The remaining gap is that *unannotated* closures like
`$fn = function(int $x): string { ... }` resolve to bare `Closure`
with no signature detail. `extract_closure_return_type_from_assignment`
extracts the return type for call-site resolution, but does not
produce a full callable type string for variable-type contexts.

**Example:**

```php
$fn = function(int $x): string { return (string)$x; };
// Extracting code that uses $fn as a parameter produces:
//   @param (Closure(): mixed) $fn
// Instead of:
//   @param (Closure(int): string) $fn
```

**What needs to change:**

1. When resolving a variable whose assignment RHS is a closure or
   arrow function, build a callable type string from the literal's
   parameter list and return type hint (e.g. `(Closure(int): string)`).
   Return this as the variable's type string instead of bare `Closure`.

2. `clean_type_for_signature` already handles parenthesized callable
   types by extracting the base name (`Closure` or `callable`), so
   the native hint will be correct.

3. `enrichment_plain` should recognise that a raw type like
   `(Closure(int): string)` already carries a full signature and
   should not be re-enriched to `(Closure(): mixed)`.

**After fixing:** verify that extract function docblock generation
emits the concrete callable signature in the `@param` tag.

---

## T14. Mixin generic substitution through multi-level inheritance
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

When a `@mixin` tag with generic arguments is declared on an ancestor
class and the descendant binds the template parameter via `@extends`,
the mixin's generic arguments are not substituted with the concrete
types from the descendant.

**Example (Laravel relationship chains):**

```php
// Relation (grandparent) declares:
//   @template TRelatedModel of Model
//   @mixin \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder<TRelatedModel>

// HasOneOrMany extends Relation<TRelatedModel, ...>
// HasMany extends HasOneOrMany<TRelatedModel, ...>

// Product model:
/** @return HasMany<ProductTranslation, $this> */
public function translations(): HasMany { ... }

// ProductTranslation defines a scope:
/** @param Builder<self> $query  @return Builder<self> */
public function scopeLanguage(Builder $query, Country $code): Builder { ... }

// Call site — language() is unreachable:
$product->translations()->language($code)->first();
//                         ^^^^^^^^ no completion, no hover
//                                         ^^^^^^^ "subject type could not be resolved"
```

**Step-by-step failure:**

1. `translations()` → `HasMany<ProductTranslation, Product>` — works.

2. `->language()` — PHPantom must follow `@mixin Builder<TRelatedModel>`
   on the grandparent `Relation`, substitute
   `TRelatedModel=ProductTranslation` through the `@extends` chain, resolve
   `Builder<ProductTranslation>`, then inject scopes from
   `ProductTranslation` (via `try_inject_builder_scopes`).  **This fails**
   because the mixin generic argument `TRelatedModel` is not substituted
   when the mixin is inherited through multiple levels — it stays as an
   unbound template parameter.

3. `->first()` — cascades: the chain is already unresolvable.

**Inconsistency:** PHPantom doesn't *flag* `language()` as an
`unknown_member` diagnostic (the diagnostic checker likely finds the
`@mixin` and gives benefit of the doubt), but can't *resolve* it
either (no completion, no hover, no return type).

**Root cause:** `collect_mixin_members` in `src/virtual_members/phpdoc.rs`
and `try_inject_builder_scopes` in `src/virtual_members/laravel/mod.rs`
expand `@mixin` declarations without applying the template substitution
map accumulated from the descendant's `@extends` generics.  When
`HasMany<ProductTranslation>` is resolved, the `@mixin Builder<TRelatedModel>`
from the grandparent `Relation` should have `TRelatedModel` replaced
with `ProductTranslation` before the mixin is expanded — but the
substitution map isn't threaded through.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/virtual_members/phpdoc.rs` — `collect_mixin_members`: accept and
  apply a template substitution map to `mixin_generics` before expanding.
- `src/virtual_members/laravel/mod.rs` — `try_inject_builder_scopes`:
  ensure the model type argument is the concrete class, not an unbound
  template parameter.
- `src/completion/types/resolution.rs` — when resolving mixin members
  inherited through the parent chain, propagate the accumulated
  `@extends` template bindings into the mixin's generic arguments.

**Impact if fixed:** ~60 diagnostics remaining in luxplus/shared
(~40 anonymous-chain + ~20 cascading unresolved_member_access).
Down from ~125 at initial discovery — partial fixes have landed but
the deepest chains still fail.  Every Eloquent relationship chain
through `HasMany`, `HasOne`, `BelongsTo`, `BelongsToMany`, etc.
hits this pattern.

---

## T15. `class-string<T>` static dispatch resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom doesn't resolve `class-string<T>` type annotations for
static member access.  When a parameter is annotated as
`@param class-string<BackedEnum> $class`, static calls like
`$class::cases()` should resolve to the methods of `BackedEnum`,
and `$class::KEY` should resolve to constants of the bound type.
Currently PHPantom treats `$class` as a plain `string`.

**Reproducer:**

```php
/**
 * @template T of CustomerModel
 * @param class-string<T> $class
 * @return null|T
 */
private function parseModel(string $class): ?CustomerModel
{
    $class::KEY;                    // "Cannot resolve type of '$class'"
    return $class::from($values);   // "Cannot resolve type of '$class'"
}
```

Also affects iteration over static method results:

```php
/** @param class-string<BackedEnum> $class */
foreach ($class::cases() as $item) {
    $item->name;   // unresolved — $item type unknown
    $item->value;  // unresolved
}
```

**What should work:** `class-string<T>` should make static member
access (`::method()`, `::CONST`, `::$prop`) resolve against `T`.
Iteration on `$class::cases()` should yield items typed as `T`.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/variable/resolution.rs` — variable type resolution
  for `class-string` types.
- `src/completion/call_resolution.rs` — static method dispatch should
  unwrap `class-string<T>` to resolve against `T`.

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 7 (F4b).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** 7 diagnostics (OptionList.php ×3,
CustomerDocument.php ×4).

---

## T16. Closure parameter type inference from generic host method
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a closure is passed to a method like
`Collection::each(callable(TValue): void)`, PHPantom should infer
the closure parameter type from the host method's template-bound
parameter type.  Currently, untyped closure parameters remain
unresolved.

**Reproducer:**

```php
/** @var Collection<int, CustomerDocument> $collection */
$collection->each(function ($class) {
    $class->someMethod();  // "Cannot resolve type of '$class'"
});
```

**What should work:** The `each` method's `@param` says the callable
receives `TValue`.  If `TValue` is bound to `CustomerDocument`, the
closure's `$class` should be typed `CustomerDocument`.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/variable/resolution.rs` — closure parameter inference.
- `src/completion/variable/rhs_resolution.rs` — resolve the host
  method's parameter type and map template arguments to the closure's
  parameter positions.

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 5 (F4).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** ~5 diagnostics.

---

## T17. Method-level template binding from closure return type
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Methods like `Collection::reduce()` declare a method-level template
parameter (`TReduceReturnType`) whose binding depends on the
closure argument's return type.  PHPantom doesn't infer method-level
template bindings from closure return types.

**Reproducer:**

```php
$total = $products->reduce(
    fn(Decimal $carry, Orderproduct $p): Decimal => $carry->add($p->price),
    new Decimal('0')
);
$total->add($order->postage);
//     ^^^ "subject type 'TReduceReturnType' could not be resolved"
```

**What should work:** The closure's return type annotation
(`Decimal`) should bind `TReduceReturnType = Decimal`, making
`reduce()` return `Decimal`.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/call_resolution.rs` —
  `resolve_method_return_types_with_args`: when a method has a
  method-level template parameter, check whether a closure argument
  provides a return type annotation that can bind it.

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 7 (F13).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** 3 diagnostics + 7 cascading
(FlowService.php L106, L343, L517).

---

## T18. `@implements` generic interface parameter type inference
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a class declares `@implements Interface<ConcreteType>`, the
generic binding should propagate to method parameter types inherited
from that interface.  Currently, parameters with no native type hint
that get their type from the interface's template parameter remain
unresolved.

**Reproducer:**

```php
/** @implements WithMapping<ProductTranslation> */
final class ProductExport implements WithMapping {
    public function map($productTranslation): array {
        $productTranslation->product;
        // "subject type could not be resolved"
    }
}
```

**What should work:** `$productTranslation` should be typed
`ProductTranslation` via the `@implements WithMapping<ProductTranslation>`
annotation, which binds the interface's template parameter.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/parser/classes.rs` — interface generic binding propagation to
  method parameters.  When resolving a method parameter's type, check
  whether the containing class has an `@implements` annotation that
  binds a template parameter used in the interface method's signature.

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 7 (F14).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** 7 diagnostics (ProductExport.php —
`name` property L51, L54, L57, L62, L63, L64, L68).

## T19. Inherited property template substitution on `$this->`
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

When a class extends a generic parent and binds its template
parameters (e.g. `@extends Collection<int, X>`), inherited property
types should have the template parameters substituted.  Currently,
`$this->items` on a class extending `Collection<int, X>` still
resolves to `array<TKey, TValue>` instead of `array<int, X>`.

**Reproducer:**

```php
/** @extends Collection<int, PurchaseFileDeviationMessage> */
final class PurchaseFileDeviationMessageCollection extends Collection {
    public function addIfUnique(PurchaseFileDeviationMessage $message): void {
        array_any($this->items, fn($item) => $item->type === ...);
        //                         ^^^^^ unresolved
    }
}
```

**What should work:** `$this->items` should resolve to
`array<int, PurchaseFileDeviationMessage>`.

**Additional note:** The `array_any()` / `array_all()` functions are
PHP 8.4 built-ins that PHPantom may lack stubs for.  Even with
explicit type hints on the closure parameter, the analyzer reports
it as unresolved when the host function is unknown.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/resolver.rs` — property type resolution on `$this`.
- `src/parser/classes.rs` — `resolve_class_with_inheritance`: apply
  template substitution to inherited property types.
- Check/add stubs for `array_any()` / `array_all()` (PHP 8.4).

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 5 (F3).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** ~5 diagnostics
(PurchaseFileDeviationMessageCollection.php ×4,
PurchaseFileProductCollection.php ×1).

## T20. `static` return type resolution to concrete subclass
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

When `Model::first()` returns `?static`, PHPantom should resolve
`static` to the concrete subclass at the call site.  Currently
`AdminUser::first()` may resolve to `?Model` instead of `?AdminUser`.

Similarly, `Arr::random()` has a complex overloaded return type that
PHPantom can't narrow based on the argument type.

**Reproducer:**

```php
$admin = AdminUser::first();
$admin->assignRole($role);  // "Cannot resolve type of '$admin'"
```

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/call_resolution.rs` — `resolve_static_return_type`:
  ensure `static` resolves to the class the method was called on, not
  the class that declares the method.

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 7 (F12).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** ~3 diagnostics (DatabaseSeeder.php,
ProductSeeder.php ×2).

## T21. `parent::method()` return type resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

PHPantom doesn't resolve the return type of `parent::method()` calls.
The return type is lost across the `parent::` dispatch, causing the
assigned variable to be unresolved.

**Reproducer:**

```php
class LoggedConnection extends BaseApiConnector {
    public function call(...): Response {
        $response = parent::call($endpoint, $params, $method, $headers);
        $response->status();   // "Cannot resolve type of '$response'"
        $response->body();     // same
    }
}
```

**What should work:** `parent::call()` should resolve to the parent
class's method and return its declared return type (`Response`).

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/call_resolution.rs` — static dispatch for `parent::`.
- `src/diagnostics/unknown_members.rs` — ensure `parent::` dispatches
  correctly.

**Discovered in:** analyze-triage iteration 7 (F11).  
**Impact in shared codebase:** 5 diagnostics (LoggedConnection.php ×4,
Paypal/Connector.php ×1).
