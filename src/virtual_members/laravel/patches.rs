//! Centralized Laravel class patch system.
//!
//! After virtual members are applied during [`resolve_class_fully_inner`],
//! certain Laravel classes need post-resolution fixups that cannot be
//! expressed as virtual member providers (which add new members) but
//! instead modify existing members' type information.
//!
//! This module provides a single entry point, [`apply_laravel_patches`],
//! that dispatches to per-class patch functions based on the fully-qualified
//! class name.  All Laravel-specific class mutations live here, making it
//! easy to audit and extend the patch inventory.
//!
//! ## Patch inventory
//!
//! 1. **`Eloquent\Builder::__call` / `__callStatic` return type.**
//!    Overrides the `mixed` return type to `static` so that method chains
//!    through unknown calls (scope dispatch, macro dispatch, Query\Builder
//!    forwarding) preserve the Builder type.
//!
//! 2. **`Conditionable::when()` / `unless()` return type.**
//!    The trait declares `@return $this|TWhenReturnType` (or a conditional
//!    form in Larastan stubs).  The unresolved `TWhenReturnType` template
//!    parameter breaks `is_self_like_type` checks, degrading Builder chains.
//!    The patch replaces the return type with `$this` so that chained
//!    `when()` / `unless()` calls preserve the receiver type.
//!
//! 3. **Bare `Builder` return types on scope methods** are handled
//!    separately in `scopes.rs` (`is_bare_builder_type`) because that
//!    patch runs at scope-injection time (post-generic-substitution),
//!    not during `resolve_class_fully_inner`.  It is documented here
//!    as part of the patch inventory but not dispatched from this module.
//!
//! 4. **`Redis\Connections\Connection` mixin.**
//!    The base `Connection` class delegates all Redis commands to the
//!    underlying `\Redis` client via `__call`, but lacks a `@mixin`
//!    annotation.  The patch injects `@mixin \Redis` **pre-resolution**
//!    (in `resolve_class_fully_inner`, before virtual member providers
//!    run) so that `collect_mixin_members` picks it up and merges
//!    `del()`, `get()`, `set()`, etc. from the stubs.  This patch is
//!    not dispatched from `apply_laravel_patches` because that runs
//!    post-resolution, after mixin collection has already completed.
//!
//! 5. **`DB` facade / `Connection` select method return types.**
//!    The facade's `@method` annotations and the underlying
//!    `Connection` class both declare `select()`,
//!    `selectFromWriteConnection()`, and `selectResultSets()` as
//!    returning bare `array`.  The actual return type is
//!    `array<int, stdClass>`.  Similarly, `selectOne()` is declared as
//!    `mixed` but actually returns `stdClass|null`.  The patch
//!    overrides these return types so that downstream property access
//!    on query results resolves correctly.
